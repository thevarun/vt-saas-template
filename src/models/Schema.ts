// This file defines the structure of your database tables using the Drizzle ORM.

// To modify the database schema:
// 1. Update this file with your desired changes.
// 2. Generate a new migration by running: `npm run db:generate`

// The generated migration file will reflect your schema changes.
// The migration is automatically applied during the next database interaction,
// so there's no need to run it manually or restart the Next.js server.

// All database schemas have been removed as part of architecture simplification
// Export empty object for drizzle compatibility
