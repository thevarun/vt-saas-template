# Step 3: Epic Completion

## STEP GOAL:

To generate the Epic Completion Report, update final status, and gracefully conclude the epic execution workflow.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator

### Orchestrator-Specific Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER modify completed story results
- 🔄 CRITICAL: Generate report from actual execution data
- 📋 YOU ARE FINALIZING the epic execution

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are an Epic Execution Orchestrator completing the workflow
- ✅ You summarize execution results accurately
- ✅ You generate comprehensive but concise reports
- ✅ You provide actionable next steps

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on reporting and finalization
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to execute additional stories
- 💬 Present clear summary to user
- 🚪 Archive or preserve sidecar as appropriate

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Gather all data from sidecar file
- 💾 Generate report using template
- 📖 Update sprint-status with epic completion
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to modify historical execution data

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Sidecar file contains complete execution history
- All story outcomes recorded in execution_log
- Sprint-status reflects final story states
- Report is the primary output of this step

---

## COMPLETION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Load Execution Data

Read the complete sidecar file at `{sidecarFile}`:

Gather:
- `epic_file`, `epic_name`
- `total_stories`
- `stories_completed` - count and list
- `stories_skipped` - count and list
- `stories_failed` - count and list
- `execution_log` - per-story details
- `started_at`, `completed_at`
- `specialist_agents_available` - agents used

Calculate:
- Total duration
- Average coverage across stories
- Total tests run/passed/failed
- Total git commits

### 2. Determine Completion Status

Based on execution results:

**Status: Completed**
- All stories finished (none skipped or failed)

**Status: Partial**
- Some stories completed, some skipped or failed

**Status: Failed**
- Critical failure caused early termination

### 3. Generate Completion Report

Create report file at `{reportOutputFolder}/epic-completion-{epic_name}-{date}.md`

Use template structure:

```markdown
# Epic Completion Report: {epic_name}

## Execution Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Epic File** | {epic_file} |
| **Started** | {started_at} |
| **Completed** | {completed_at} |
| **Duration** | {total_duration} |
| **Status** | {completion_status} |

## Stories Execution

| Story | Title | Status | Agent | Coverage | Tests | Duration |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|----------|-------|----------|
[For each story in execution_log]
| {story} | {title} | {status} | {agent} | {coverage}% | {passed}/{total} | {duration} |

### Stories Completed: {completed_count}/{total_count}

## Quality Metrics

- **Average Coverage:** {avg_coverage}%
- **Total Tests Run:** {total_tests}
- **Tests Passed:** {passed_tests}
- **Tests Failed:** {failed_tests}
- **Git Commits Created:** {commit_count}

## Agent Selection Summary

| Agent | Stories Handled | Selection Reason |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
[For each unique agent used]
| {agent_name} | [{story_list}] | {selection_reason} |

## Issues & Escalations

### Retries
[For each story that required retries]
- {story}: {retry_reason} - {outcome}

### Escalations
[For each story that required user decision]
- {story}: {escalation_reason} - {resolution}

### Blockers Encountered
[List any blockers that occurred]
- {blocker_description}

## Session Information

- **Orchestrator Sessions:** {session_count}
- **Resume Points:** {resume_count}
- **Sidecar File:** {sidecar_path}
```

### 4. Update Sprint Status

Update `{sprintStatus}` to reflect epic completion:

```yaml
epic-N: done  # or partial
epic-N-retrospective: optional
```

### 4.5 Cleanup Specialist Agents

Remove epic-specific agents created during initialization:

**1. Read from sidecar:**
```yaml
specialist_agents_created:
  - name: "auth-specialist"
    path: ".claude/agents/vt-bmad-dev-agents/auth-specialist.md"
```

**2. Delete each agent file:**
```bash
rm .claude/agents/vt-bmad-dev-agents/auth-specialist.md
rm .claude/agents/vt-bmad-dev-agents/frontend-forms.md
...
```

**3. Log cleanup:**
Add to report:
```markdown
## Agent Cleanup
- Deleted: auth-specialist.md
- Deleted: frontend-forms.md
- Total agents cleaned up: X
```

**4. Verify cleanup:**
```bash
ls .claude/agents/vt-bmad-dev-agents/
```
- If empty or only contains non-epic agents → success
- If files remain unexpectedly → warn user

### 5. Handle Sidecar File

Present option to user:

"Epic execution complete! The execution state file contains detailed logs.

Options:
- [A] Archive sidecar (move to `{output_folder}/archive/`)
- [K] Keep sidecar in place
- [D] Delete sidecar (execution data preserved in report)"

### 5.5 Conduct Retrospective

Run retrospective workflow for completed epic:

**Ask user:**
"Would you like to run a retrospective for this epic?
- [Y] Yes, run retrospective
- [N] No, skip retrospective"

**If Yes:**
1. Invoke `/retrospective` skill with epic context
2. Wait for retrospective completion
3. Store output path in report:
```markdown
## Retrospective
- Completed: Yes
- Output: {implementation_artifacts}/epic-N-retro-{date}.md
```

**If No:**
- Update sprint-status: `epic-N-retrospective: skipped`
- Note in report: "Retrospective: Skipped by user"

### 6. Create Pull Request

Generate and create PR for this epic's work:

**1. Gather PR content:**
- Title: "Epic {N}: {epic_name}"
- Body from completion report:
  - Stories completed count
  - Quality metrics summary
  - Agent usage summary
  - Link to completion report

**2. Create PR:**
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "Epic {N}: {epic_name}" \
  --base {baseBranch} \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Automated implementation of Epic {N}: {epic_name}

### Stories Completed
- {completed_count}/{total_count} stories implemented
- Coverage: {avg_coverage}%
- Tests: {passed_tests}/{total_tests} passed
