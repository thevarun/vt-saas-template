# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
